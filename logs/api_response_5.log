The deliverable should identify definitions and origins, terminology variants, a historical timeline of milestones, stakeholders, canonical resources, and alternative/critical viewpoints. All findings must be grounded in authoritative sources with full citation metadata and URLs, and references must be listed at the end without inline citations.\n\nImportant note: You instructed that I MUST use the local_search_tool to retrieve information from your provided resource files (Space 1). At this time, attempts to use the local_search_tool are failing with a tool-side error (NameError: name 'max_total_tokens' is not defined), which prevents me from accessing Space 1. As a result, I cannot retrieve or cite content from your local resources yet.\n\nResearch Findings\nBecause the required local resource access is currently unavailable due to the tool error, I cannot provide verified findings or citations from Space 1 at this moment. Below is a structured outline of what I will extract and report once access is restored, followed by specific next steps to proceed immediately if you allow external web sources.\n\nPlanned Extraction Structure (once local_search_tool is working)\n- Definitions and origin\n  - Identify earliest documented uses of “GraphRAG,” “Graph-RAG,” “KG-RAG,” “Knowledge Graph RAG,” “Knowledge-Graph-augmented RAG,” and similar.\n  - Capture who coined and/or popularized the term(s), with exact quotes, author(s), organization, publication date, and URL.\n  - Collect official descriptions from research labs, vendors, open-source maintainers, standards bodies, and conference tutorials.\n\n- Terminology variants and distinctions\n  - GraphRAG vs. KG-RAG vs. knowledge-graph-augmented RAG vs. graph-augmented RAG.\n  - Clarify conceptual overlaps (e.g., graph construction vs. use of pre-existing knowledge graphs) and differences (e.g., graph type, retrieval strategies, prompting vs. pipeline logic).\n\n- Historical timeline (2023–2025)\n  - Initial proposals, whitepapers, notable talks.\n  - Major releases (GitHub repos), notable issues/PRs, version tags.\n  - Conference publications (ACL/EMNLP/NeurIPS/ICLR/KDD/SIGMOD/WWW), workshops, and tutorials.\n  - Benchmark announcements and evaluation claims.\n\n- Stakeholders and ecosystems\n  - Research groups, maintainers, vendors, and database providers (e.g., graph DBs).\n  - Tools/frameworks integrating GraphRAG-like capabilities.\n  - Roles, products, claims, and positioning.\n\n- Canonical resources\n  - Official repositories and technical docs (with license info).\n  - Academic papers, preprints, patents.\n  - Standards or best-practice guides.\n  - Notable community posts/discussions.\n\n- Alternative/critical viewpoints\n  - Critiques comparing GraphRAG vs. vector-only RAG.\n  - Concerns about complexity, engineering overhead, cost, scalability, reliability.\n  - Counterpoints and mitigation strategies.\n  - Any stated evaluation claims to follow up later.\n\nData Capture Schema (for each source)\n- Title\n- Exact quote(s) for definitions/claims (when applicable)\n- Authors\n- Organization/affiliation\n- Publication date (verify and normalize to ISO 8601)\n- URL\n- Snapshot/abstract (short)\n- Resource type (paper, blog, repo, doc, talk, tutorial, benchmark, patent, forum post)\n- Venue (if applicable)\n- Licensing info (for code repos)\n- Stated evaluation claims (if any), and dataset/benchmark references\n- Notes on perspective (proponent, neutral, critical)\n- Relevance tags (definition, timeline, stakeholder, critique, etc.)\n\nContingency Plan to Proceed with External Sources (requires your approval)\nIf you authorize using external web sources while the local tool is fixed, I will:\n- Search targets:\n  - Research lab posts and repos likely linked to GraphRAG terminology.\n  - Well-known LLM tooling/framework docs that discuss GraphRAG/KG-RAG.\n  - Graph database vendors’ blogs and docs discussing RAG with graphs or knowledge graphs.\n  - Major conferences (ACL/EMNLP/NeurIPS/ICLR/KDD/SIGMOD/WWW) proceedings and tutorials for 2023–2025.\n  - Community discussions and critical analyses comparing graph-based RAG vs vector-only RAG.\n\n- Output:\n  - A fully cited, timeline-ordered summary (2023–2025).\n  - Definitions with exact quotes, attributions, and dates.\n  - Stakeholder map with roles, products, claims.\n  - Canonical repos with license info.\n  - Critical viewpoints and counterpoints.\n  - All sources listed in the References section (no inline citations).\n\nConclusion\nI’m ready to compile the requested, fully cited research brief. However, I cannot access Space 1 due to a local_search_tool runtime error. Please either:\n- Fix or re-enable the local_search_tool so I can extract from your resource files as required, or\n- Grant permission to proceed with external web sources (web_search and crawl_tool) temporarily, or\n- Provide direct links or documents from Space 1 so I can crawl them.\n\nOnce I have access, I will deliver the complete report with definitions, terminology, 2023–2025 timeline, stakeholders, canonical resources, and critical viewpoints, including precise quotes and full citation metadata.\n\nReferences\nNo sources could be cited yet because the required local resource tool (local_search_tool) failed to run. Please enable access or authorize external sources so I can provide a fully referenced report.\n</finding>\n\n# Current Step\n\n## Title\n\nTechnical Deep Dive: Architecture, Algorithms, Implementations, Benchmarks, and Use Cases\n\n## Description\n\nGather detailed technical and empirical information required for a comprehensive understanding:\n- Architecture and pipelines: Data ingestion, entity/relation extraction (NER/RE models), graph construction (schema, ontologies), community detection (e.g., Louvain/Leiden variants), hierarchical summarization, indexing strategies (graph index vs vector index), retrieval strategies (subgraph retrieval, path reasoning), and generation prompts.
